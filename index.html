                    <strong>OptimaScan by MetaOptima Technology Inc.</strong> is the most exciting project I have ever worked on. It brings together
                    hardware communications, macOS development, and iOS development to create a
                    sophisticated mechanism poised to revolutionize dermatology, which I am
                    truly proud of.

                  <p>
                    Throughout its development, I leveraged a wide array of cutting-edge technologies from
                    low-level hardware interfaces (BLE, Wi-Fi, and custom firmware protocols) to modern
                    Swift/macOS frameworks (SwiftUI, Combine, Core Bluetooth, P2P communication, Metal, and more) to deliver a
                    seamless, high-performance experience across the entire hardware–software stack.
                    I also developed a custom firmware for the hardware device, which allows for the seamless integration of the hardware with the software.

                    As an iOS Developer at SoundStorming, I led the development
                    of the iOS app and oversaw other technical aspects such as
                    website development and database management. Since the role
                    was part-time, I honed my time management skills to juggle
                    diverse responsibilities alongside other commitments. This
                    experience elevated my organizational and discipline skills,
                    making me a more efficient and effective professional.

                  <p>
                    In this app I used firebase as a backend solution, I also
                    used firebase as our database and user behaviour analysis
                    ans swift 5.0 for iOS Version.

                    Being part of this team
                    was an outstanding experience for me since I got the

                    This is iMoozik. With this application, you can search and
                    download any song on the internet into your iOS Device. You
                    can also make playlists for yourself.

                    This is SMS Police. This app separates the spam SMS messages
                    and puts it in a different folder on your iOS device's
                    official messages app.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Apple doesn't allow developers to read or manipulate SMS
                    Messages but with the help of "Message Filter Extension" we
                    can create an app with some rules specified in it that can
                    decide if a message is spam or nor.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    I used <strong>machine learning</strong> in this app so the
                    ML model will get better in deciding which message is spam.

                    In this app, I put another passion of mine into app
                    development and that is “Magic tricks”. I made some magical
                    code that somehow “I won’t tell ya :D” it can give you the
                    information when you get a picture from your friend’s face.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    All your friends will think that you are a special secret
                    agent and you should never tell them how this app works.

                  <p>But I know you will, LOL.</p>

                    I have a huge interest in making games with unity but in
                    this project, I wanted to see if I can make a game with just
                    pure swift.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    I have some experience with spriteKit for 2d games and
                    sceneKit for 3d games but in this game, I didn't use them
                    and made everything with default iOS methods.

                    This is another game that I developed with pure swift and in
                    this game, numbers will fall from the top of the screen and
                    before they reach the keypad you should type those numbers.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Game speed will increase over time and also the numbers will
                    get bigger.

                <br />
                <p>
                  As an experienced iOS developer, I have worked on numerous
                  projects and have gained expertise in various technologies and
                  tools. My tech stack includes the latest iOS development
                  frameworks such as UIKit, SwiftUI, CoreData, and
                  CoreAnimation. I have also worked with third-party libraries
                  such as Alamofire, Snapkit, Fabric Crashlytics, Firebase, and
                  PayCardsRecognizer to implement advanced features in my apps.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In addition, I am familiar with game development frameworks
                  such as SpriteKit, SceneKit, and Unity(C#) and have experience
                  in integrating payment gateway SDKs and social media libraries
                  like Facebook Sign in, Google Sign in, and Apple Sign in. I
                  also have knowledge in backend development technologies like
                  MongoDB, SQL, and Firebase to develop serverless applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With a passion for keeping up-to-date with the latest trends
                  and technologies in the industry, I am always excited to learn
                  and implement new features into my apps. I believe that my
                  technical skills and dedication to producing high-quality work
                  can make a significant contribution to any iOS development
                  project.
